LAPTOP REAPIR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ::
**********************************

It is a project on Laptop Repair Shop management system which consists of 
different modules.
The Project is divided into two different parts :
    i) Shopping Management System 
   ii) Repair Management System
    
1. Shopping Management System :
*******************************
In this part I have used simple basic c++ coding in which a customer can 
purchase the items which I have listed in Shopkeeper Portal using "cout".
The Shopkeeper has to enter the no. of products Customer wants to purchase and
according to that "Item Name" and "Item Qunatity" will be asked for customer 
for which i have used "for loops" concept.
Also I have used "goto" statement so that shopkeeper can again re-enter the 
number of products that another customer wants to purchase and so on.

2. Repair Shop Management System :
**********************************
For this part I have used some additional header files i.e,
        1) #include<sstream>
        2) #include<cstdlib>
        3) #include<string>
These all header files are not included in <iostream> header file.

Then after I have created 5 different modules i.e,

        1) For Adding Customer
        2) For Search
        3) For Update
                i) Name Update
               ii) Number Update
        4) For Delete
        5) For Showall       

The concept behind creating these modules was that , when a customer come to a
repair shop, he need to give his details so that repair technician can contact him as soon as his device is repaired for which i have created Add Customer module which deals with writing of details of customer into a file.
For writing details of customer into a file , i have used the concept of File Handling.

In a repair shop there may be many customers. If we want to know the details of any particular customer we need to search for him. For this I have created a search function which open the file in read mode and gives the details of searched customer if it exists.

In a repair shop if a customer have provided wrong information then there might be possibility that the customer might not get the product or the technician cannot contact to the customer. So for this I have created a Update function which can update your name, number, address. To create this again I have used the concept of File Handling and file change concept.

In a repair shop when the product is being repaired then the details of customer has to be deleted. For this i have created a delete function through which the shopkeeper can delete the customer information manually.For this also I have used the concept of File Handling.

Also in shop, if Shopkeeper wants to see all customers , for that i have created a show function which shows all the customers of the Repair shop.
For this also again I have the concept of File Handling to show all customers with their details present in file.

So it was all about "Laptop Repair Management System" which is written in basic c++ language.
