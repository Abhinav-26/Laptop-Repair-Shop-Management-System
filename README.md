This is a desktop based software for Laptop Repair Shop. It is a static software build in C++. This consists of two 
interfaces :
  1. For Customer management in Shop i.e, Repair Technician.
  2. For Selling Products i.e, Shopkeeper.
  
# Customer Management :
# ***********************
In this portal I have used 5 different modules for giving shopkeeper oppertunity to deal with customer in efficient way
(1). Add_Customer.cpp
(2). Delete.cpp
(3). Login.cpp
(4). Search.cpp
(5). Update.cpp
              
I have used the concept of Object Oriented Programming to create these modules. Thses modules are dynamic in nature. You can add , delete, update, search, customers any time.

# Shopkeeper :
# **************
This is a completely static module in which I have printed some of the available products using cout and designed it in a beautiful way. The customer can buy any of the available items shown in cart and they can buy as many no. of items they want to buy. For billing purpose I have used basic arthimatic logics which will calculate your bill and give you output accordingly.


So this is all about LPS Management System. Hope you like it :-)
